Tech Challenge based upon the OpenLibrary API

To create this project I used create-react-app, axios, lodash.debounce and react-router-dom. The latter three need be installed in order for the app to run ($npm install axios react-router-dom lodash.debounce)

If you would like to see a deployed version of the app it is available here:
